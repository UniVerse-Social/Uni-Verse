    <section id="scope">
      <h2>1) Scope &amp; Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We provide a social and community platform for students and nearby communities across the United States, featuring DMs, clubs, events, marketplace, matching, and live games.</p>
      <p>We are not an emergency service. In an emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number.</p>
      <p><strong>U.S. residents only.</strong> The Services are intended for individuals who reside in the United States and access UniVerse from the U.S.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="collection">
      <h2>2) Personal Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information you provide, information collected automatically, and information from service providers and partners. We aim to avoid collecting precise geolocation data.</p>

      <h3 id="you-provide">A. Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account &amp; Verification:</strong> name/username, email address (which may be a student or school-associated email), phone number (for SMS verification), password or authentication tokens, and verification codes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Profile:</strong> photos (for profile and matching features), bio, interests, school affiliation or campus information you choose to add, and other profile fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content &amp; Activity:</strong> posts, comments, DMs, club and event listings, marketplace listings, reactions, game stats, and other in-app actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchases:</strong> when you buy coins or other virtual items, payment processing is handled by app stores or payment processors. We receive limited transactional metadata (e.g., transaction ID, amount, status), not your full card number.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reports &amp; Support:</strong> content you send when you report users/content or contact support (e.g., screenshots, message IDs, explanations).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="auto">B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Device &amp; Log Data:</strong> device identifier, device model, operating system, app version, language, network type, approximate location from IP address, timestamps, referrers, and crash logs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> in-app screens and features you interact with, basic engagement metrics, and approximate time spent in the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cookies &amp; SDKs:</strong> we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies (such as SDKs) for authentication, security, analytics, and advertising measurement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="providers">C. Information From Service Providers/Partners</h3>
      <p>Analytics, anti-abuse, and advertising partners may provide aggregated or pseudonymous signals (e.g., crash analytics, spam scores, ad measurement). We do not purchase “data broker” dossiers about you.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="purposes">
      <h2>3) Why We Use Your Information (Purposes)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Provide the Services:</strong> account creation, login, email/SMS verification, profile and matching, DMs, clubs, events, marketplace, and games.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety &amp; Integrity:</strong> detect and prevent spam, abuse, fraud, and security incidents; enforce our Terms and Community Guidelines; and protect UniVerse and other users.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> personalize your experience, such as recommended content, profiles, and limited ad personalization where allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement &amp; Improvement:</strong> analyze usage, fix bugs, and improve the Services using analytics and research (often in aggregated or de-identified form).</li>
        <li><strong>Payments &amp; Purchases:</strong> deliver coins and other virtual items, manage your entitlements, and confirm payment status via app stores or payment processors.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> send you service messages (e.g., security alerts or policy updates), as well as optional notifications you can control in settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal &amp; Compliance:</strong> comply with legal obligations, enforce agreements, and respond to lawful requests.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="sharing">
      <h2>4) How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We share information in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers &amp; Contractors:</strong> vendors that help us operate UniVerse (e.g., hosting, analytics, security, customer support, email/SMS providers, and payment processors). They are contractually bound to use data only to provide services to us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising &amp; Measurement Partners:</strong> to show, measure, and improve ads. Where this is considered “sharing” under California law for cross-context behavioral advertising, you may have the right to opt out (see Section 9).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Users:</strong> information you choose to publish (e.g., profile, posts, event/club listings, marketplace listings, in-game name) is viewable by others according to your settings and our product design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal, Safety, and Protection:</strong> we may disclose information to law enforcement, regulators, or other third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with law, respond to legal requests, protect the rights, safety, or property of UniVerse, our users, or others, or to enforce our Terms and policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> if we are involved in a transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information for money.</strong> However, we may “share” identifiers and usage data with advertising partners for ad personalization and measurement, which may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under certain state privacy laws. See Section 9 for your rights.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="controls">
      <h2>5) Your Controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Profile &amp; Content:</strong> you can update or delete certain profile fields and content (like posts or listings) through in-app settings and controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> you may control certain notification types in settings. Some service or legal notices are required and cannot be turned off (e.g., security alerts, material changes to Terms).</li>
        <li><strong>Ads &amp; Cookies:</strong> in addition to in-app controls (where available), you can use your device or platform settings (e.g., Apple/Google ad preferences) and browser cookie controls to manage personalization and tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Access, Deletion, and Other Privacy Requests:</strong> see Section 9 for California-specific rights, which we may choose to honor more broadly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="retention">
      <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, or as required by law. Actual retention periods may vary depending on context.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> generally retained while your account is active. If you delete your account, we typically delete or de-identify most associated personal data within a reasonable period (for example, 30–90 days), subject to technical and legal constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Content &amp; DMs:</strong> retained until you delete them or your account is deleted. Content shared with others may remain visible in their accounts or in group spaces where they have rights to access it.</li>
        <li><strong>Security &amp; logs:</strong> may be retained for a period (for example, up to 24 months) to help us detect abuse, investigate incidents, and meet legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> backups are typically maintained on a rolling basis (for example, ≤30 days) and are deleted or overwritten in the ordinary course of business.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad measurement/analytics:</strong> may be retained for a period (for example, up to 13 months) in aggregated or pseudonymous form.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may update these example ranges over time and will modify this Policy if retention practices materially change.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="children">
      <h2>7) Children &amp; Students</h2>
      <p>The Services are intended for users ages 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has created an account or provided personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete the account and associated data.</p>
      <p>We may use student or school-associated email addresses solely to help verify eligibility (for example, to confirm that you are a student). This does not give your school access to your UniVerse account or data.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>8) Security</h2>
      <p>We use organizational and technical measures designed to protect information, such as HTTPS, access controls, encryption at rest (where supported by our infrastructure), and monitoring for abuse.</p>
      <p>No system is 100% secure. You can help protect your account by using a strong password, enabling any available security features, and not sharing your credentials or verification codes. If you discover a potential vulnerability, please email <a href="mailto:security@uni-verse.social">security@uni-verse.social</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="california">
      <h2>9) California Privacy Rights (CPRA)</h2>
      <p>If you are a California resident, you may have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Know/Access:</strong> to request information about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> to request deletion of personal information we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Correct:</strong> to request correction of inaccurate personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Opt Out of “Sale”/“Sharing”:</strong> if we “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by CPRA—for example, sharing identifiers and usage data with advertising partners for cross-context behavioral advertising—you may opt out via any “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link we provide.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information:</strong> we use sensitive personal information (such as phone number) primarily for verification and security; we do not use it for additional purposes that would require a “limit use” control.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> we will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
      <p>You can submit privacy requests by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@uni-verse.social">privacy@uni-verse.social</a> with “California Privacy Request” in the subject line. We may ask you to verify your identity (for example, via email or SMS code) to protect your account.</p>
      <p>If you use an authorized agent, we may require documentation showing their authority and also verify your identity directly.</p>

      <h3>Notice at Collection (Summary)</h3>
      <p>
        We collect identifiers (e.g., email, phone, device IDs), internet or network activity (logs, cookies/SDKs),
        user content, and approximate location (from IP). We use these for purposes such as providing and securing
        the Services, personalization, analytics, and advertising. We share this data with service providers and,
        where applicable, advertising/measurement partners. Retention practices are summarized in Section 6.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="cookies">
      <h2>10) Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>We and our partners use cookies, SDKs, and similar technologies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep you logged in and maintain your session;</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud and abuse;</li>
        <li>Measure usage and performance;</li>
        <li>Support advertising and ad measurement.</li>

      <h2>12) Changes to This Policy</h2>
