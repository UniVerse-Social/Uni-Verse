        <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy matters. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand what information we collect, how we use and share it, and your rights and choices.

        <h2>13. Data Processing and International Transfers</h2>
        <p>We may process and store information in the United States and other countries where we or our service providers operate.

        <h2>24. Appendix A — Detailed Provisions (California &amp; Local)</h2>
        <h3>A1. California Privacy Rights (CPRA)</h3>
        <p>If we engage in cross-context behavioral advertising (e.g., through Google Ads), California residents may have the right to opt out of “sale” or “sharing” of personal information and to limit the use of sensitive personal information. We will provide a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link and explain choices in the Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>A2. California Minors</h3>
        <p>If we permit users aged 13–17, California’s “minor eraser” rules allow minors to request removal of their own content (with some exceptions). See the Privacy Policy for how to submit requests.</p>
        <h3>A3. Automatic Renewal Disclosures</h3>
        <p>If we later add auto-renewing subscriptions, California’s Automatic Renewal Law requires clear, conspicuous terms, affirmative consent, post-purchase acknowledgement, and easy web cancellation. We will update these Terms and in-app flows before enabling subscriptions.</p>

        <h3>A9. Security; Responsible Disclosure</h3>
