        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction (13+ in the U.S.). The Services are not for children under 13.</p>
        <p>
          UniVerse is designed primarily for college and university students and nearby communities in the United States,
          but is not operated by any college or university. Use of UniVerse does not create any relationship with an
          educational institution.
        </p>
        <p><strong>U.S. residents only.</strong> The Services are offered solely in the United States. You represent that you reside in the U.S. and will not access the Services from outside the U.S.</p>
        <p>You may not use the Services if you are prohibited from doing so under applicable laws or if your account was previously suspended or terminated by us.</p>
        <p>You represent that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it up to date.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="no-university-affiliation">
        <h2>2. No University Affiliation or Control</h2>
        <p>
          UniVerse Social is an independent project operating at <strong>Uni-verse.social</strong>.
          No college, university, or school district operates, controls, moderates, sponsors, or endorses UniVerse,
          and they do not have administrative or moderation access to the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any references to campuses, student life, or schools are for descriptive purposes only. Your use of UniVerse
          does not create any relationship with your school. If you organize activities on campus or use university resources,
          you are responsible for complying with your institution’s policies independently from these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may respond to valid legal requests from law enforcement or campus security departments as required by law.

      <section id="account">
        <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
        <p>You may need to register for an account to access some or all of the Services. You agree to keep your login credentials confidential and are responsible for all activity under your account.</p>
        <p><strong>Verification.</strong> To help keep the community safer and more relevant to students, we may verify accounts using email (including student or school-associated domains) and SMS text codes. By registering, you consent to receive one-time verification texts and emails (standard carrier rates apply). You can opt out of non-essential communications in settings.</p>
        <p>Using a school email to verify your status does <strong>not</strong> mean your school sponsors or endorses UniVerse.</p>
        <p>You must notify us promptly at <a href="mailto:support@uni-verse.social">support@uni-verse.social</a> of any unauthorized use or suspected security breach.</p>
        <p>We may offer verified accounts or similar features subject to additional requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>License to UniVerse.</strong> To operate, improve, and promote the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicensable license to host, store, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works (such as format transformations or translations), publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute your User Content only as necessary to provide the Services and as described in these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and product features you use.</p>
        <p>This license ends when you delete your User Content from the Services, except: (i) to the extent your content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it; (ii) for reasonable backup and archival copies retained for a limited period; and (iii) as required by law, dispute resolution, or to enforce our Terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback.</strong> If you provide ideas, suggestions, or feedback, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable license to use them without restriction or compensation.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Responsibilities.</strong> You are responsible for your User Content and represent that you have the necessary rights to grant the above licenses and that your content complies with these Terms and applicable laws.</p>

        <h2>8. Feature-Specific Terms</h2>

        <h3>Profiles, Matching, and Discovery</h3>
        <p>To use profile and matching features, you allow us to display your profile (including photos and basic info) to other users. You represent that you own or have permission to use any photo you upload, and that it does not infringe the privacy, publicity, or IP rights of others. We do not use facial recognition or biometric templates.</p>

        <h3>Clubs, Groups &amp; Events</h3>
        <p>Club, group, and event listings are provided by users. You are responsible for verifying details (location, time, host, capacity).

Do not claim or imply that an event is officially sponsored by a university unless you have written authorization from that institution.</p>

        <h3>Marketplace</h3>
        <p>Listings and transactions are between users, not with UniVerse. We do not screen listings, take possession of items, or process payments. Prohibited listings include: illegal items; weapons; drugs; stolen property; counterfeit goods; adult content; and any item banned by campus or local policies. Meet in public places, comply with the law, and use common sense. We are not liable for user-to-user transactions.</p>

      <section id="ip">
        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Services, including software, graphics, logos, trademarks (including UniVerse, Uni-verse.social, and associated marks), and content provided by us, are protected by intellectual property laws.

        <h2>10. Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
        <p>The Services may link to or integrate with third-party websites, apps, SDKs, analytics providers, or advertising partners (“Third-Party Services”). We are not responsible for Third-Party Services and your use may be subject to their terms and privacy policies. You control whether to enable or disable certain integrations where offered.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising.</strong> The Services may display ads in various placements. Ad partners may set cookies or similar technologies to measure and personalize ads.

        <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy matters. Please review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> to understand what information we collect, how we use and share it, and your rights and choices. Certain features (e.g., camera, microphone, push notifications) require your permission in your device settings. We do not collect precise geolocation; location-aware features may rely on approximate information such as IP region.</p>
        <p>Student or school-associated email addresses are collected and used primarily for verification and account security, not for any relationship with your institution.</p>

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple/Google have no other warranty obligations.</li>

        <h2>24. Appendix A — Additional Provisions (U.S.)</h2>
        <h3>A1. California Privacy Rights (CPRA)</h3>
        <p>If we engage in cross-context behavioral advertising, California residents may have the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information and to limit the use of sensitive personal information. We will provide any required “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link and explain choices in the Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>A2. California Minors</h3>
        <p>If we permit users aged 13–17, California’s “minor eraser” rules may allow minors to request removal of their own content (with some exceptions). See the Privacy Policy for how to submit requests.</p>
        <h3>A3. Automatic Renewal Disclosures</h3>
        <p>If we add auto-renewing subscriptions, California’s Automatic Renewal Law may require clear, conspicuous terms, affirmative consent, post-purchase acknowledgement, and easy web cancellation. We will update these Terms and in-app flows before enabling subscriptions.</p>
        <h3>A4. Not an Emergency Service</h3>
        <p>The Services are not a substitute for calling 911 or contacting local emergency services. If you or someone else is in danger, contact emergency services immediately.</p>
        <h3>A5. U.S.-Only Access and Export Compliance</h3>
        <p>You represent you are a U.S. resident using the Services from the U.S. You agree to comply with U.S. export and sanctions laws. We may restrict access by IP, phone, or payment method.</p>
        <h3>A6. DMCA / IP Takedowns</h3>

          Agent: DMCA Agent<br>
          Email: <a href="mailto:dmca@uni-verse.social">dmca@uni-verse.social</a><br>
          Address: [Postal address]<br>
        </address>
        <p>Counter-notices should be sent to the same agent. We may remove repeat infringers.</p>
        <h3>A7. Security; Responsible Disclosure</h3>
        <p>If you discover a vulnerability, report it to <a href="mailto:security@uni-verse.social">security@uni-verse.social</a>. Don’t exploit or publicly disclose before we’ve had a reasonable chance to remediate. Rewards, if any, are at our discretion.</p>
