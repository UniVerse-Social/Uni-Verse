# To Do
- [ ] Terms and conditions — Add terms and conditions so users are allowed to know what the website is allowed to use data wise and that the user agrees to these terms to avoid legality. Also, make sure to put a *Not affiliated with Cal State Fullerton* notice to avoid any conflict with the school.

- [ ] Put the logo, navlink buttons, and dm button in certain positions for every screen: (Logo at the top left) (navblink buttons in the top center) (dm button in the top right)

- [ ] add signup requirements

- [ ] make the homepage screen flush with the designs (homepage, club page, titantap page)

- [ ] If we delete/edit posts make it so it lives updates without having to refresh the page. 

- [ ] if a post is edited, make an indicator + timestamp showing when it was edited

- [ ] add count next to comments

- [ ] Add dm button to every screen aside from home screen: TitanTap, Clubs, Games, Profile
