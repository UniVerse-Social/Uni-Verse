# To Do
- [ ] Terms and conditions — Add terms and conditions so users are allowed to know what the website is allowed to use data wise and that the user agrees to these terms to avoid legality. Also, make sure to put a *Not affiliated with Cal State Fullerton* notice to avoid any conflict with the school.

- [ ] add the EULA button in the signup page
