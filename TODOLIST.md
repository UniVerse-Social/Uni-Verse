# To Do
- [ ] Terms and conditions — Add terms and conditions so users are allowed to know what the website is allowed to use data wise and that the user agrees to these terms to avoid legality. Also, make sure to put a *Not affiliated with Cal State Fullerton* notice to avoid any conflict with the school.

- [ ] Profile Banners — Add banners related to your club and positions and we could add achievements related to user usage like platinum or gold users after so many likes, followers or posts etc. Also if a game system is implemented, add a trophy system for people to flex their skills. The first 100 users should also receive a banner that tells everyone they were one of the first users. Make the banners adjustable so the user can choose what to display.

- [ ] Launch the App — Launch on a VPS, obtain a public domain, get any other services like an email confirmation service, safe payment service or anything like that need to run live

- [ ] UI Advancement — Make it pretty

- [ ] Password Recovery — Allow users to recover their password via email and phone number verification on the login page as a little clickable button that brings the user to a confirmation page before getting a new password and signing in again.

- [ ] Create an “edit profile” option in the setting tab on profile — This tab should allow users to edit their username, bio, email(with verification), phone number(with verification) and password(after retyping the past password twice)

- [ ] Marketplace and Gigs — Allows users to post listings for items to sell like books or other items typically related to school, allow for 1-10 pictures, title, description, condition, and meeting location on posts. Users should have the ability to message the listing owner for more information on meet up and hand off. Allow listing to be posted for free under restricted listing options, but create a small paid tier of $1-3 that promotes the listing to the top of every users marketplace and moves the listing on top of every related search. Create a search bar that allows users to look for specific items. 

- [ ] Club features — Create a more user friendly interface, fix the revoke on main chat settings, allow everyone to be able to comment and like posts when revoked from posting in channels, allow for private channels in clubs, create invite only option for clubs that limits who can join(users who want to join will have to wait for their join request to be accepted by a club admin or president. Potential for club challenges or events, add an event tab for any major news and weekly games for users to connect with other people(chess tournaments, snake challenges etc.). The main game tab will allow users to connect with another player in matchmaking and play against them. The event tab will announce any game events like tournaments for banners and such

- [ ] Create Ad revenue stream — small ad banner every 10th post and side bar ads on home page and a bottom banner on the club page for now

- [ ] Add pictures to normal and club posts as an option — allows users to do more with posts, allow 1-3 pictures per post

- [ ] create "Remember Me" check box on the log in page — user ease of access, make sure this only works if signed in on the same device

- [ ] 2 factor authentication — on login, require users who haven't logged in within 3 days to verify their log in attempt via email verification or text message code

- [ ] phone number — require phone number on sign up to verify the user and provide future 2 factor authentication

- [ ] Sign up email verification — require the new users to have a valid email address and redirect the user to verify their email before account creation.
